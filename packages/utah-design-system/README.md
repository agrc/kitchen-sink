# UGRC Design System

This is UGRC's [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) plus [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) implementation of the [Utah Design System](https://designsystem.utah.gov/).

## Tailwind Colors

This design system expects Tailwind CSS primary, secondary, and accent colors ranging from 50-950. The UGRC default presets can be used for this from [@ugrc/tailwind-preset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ugrc/tailwind-preset).

## Header

The Header component requires a custom font for the SVG text.

## Layer Selector

This is a component that allows the user to quickly toggle visibility of layers or base maps in a web map. It has `baseLayers`, `operationalLayers`, and `referenceLayers` options that allow you to add layers to the corresponding properties of your map's [Basemap](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-Basemap.html). It also supports adding entire base maps via the `basemaps` property. When this property is used, the individual parts of the base map (`baseLayers` and `referenceLayers`) are mixed into the base map that Layer Selector manages.

Layers defined in `baseLayers` or `basemaps` are represented as a radio buttons in a single group. You are required to pass at least one value to at least one of these properties. The first value in `basemaps` is selected by default. If no value is passed to `basemaps`, then the first value in `baseLayers` is selected by default. The `operationalLayers` and `referenceLayers` properties are represented as checkboxes.
